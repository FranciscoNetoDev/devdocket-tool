# TaskBora Frontend (Angular Placeholder)

This directory holds the frontend for TaskBora. The previous Supabase-based React app has been removed to make room for an Angular implementation that will consume the .NET API in `backend/`.

## Next steps
- Scaffold an Angular workspace (e.g., `ng new taskbora-web`) inside this folder.
- Point the Angular HTTP services to the ASP.NET Core API endpoints exposed by `TaskBora.Presentation.Api`.
- Keep this folder at the same hierarchy level as `backend/` to simplify solution management.
